Theo Generated Sample Notes
Overall:
Uniform balance of trap types in each Pearl level bucket
Description of process:
YES validity has causal structure, no trap type
AMBIGUOUS validity has no causal structure, hidden timestamp with conditionals
NO validity has causal structure, trap type and trap sub-type
Question themes focus often on cryptocurrencies, or high-frequency trading algorithms interacting with market volatility.
Should also include a summary of the prompt used for generation in an Appendix section.
Associations:
“Yes” cases are characterized by historical correlations. They are also often simple two variable causal structures.
Survivorship Bias and Collider -> Case Control seem pretty much equivalent.
Ambiguous cases can be determined by looking for a variable indicating something “during the same period”. 
Interventions:
“Loop” or “reinforcing” terms in scenario -> Feedback loop trap type
Also observing similar trends as per associations in how to classify AMBIGUOUS and YES samples.
For YES samples, indicator words include “uniformly”, “randomly assigned”, “stable conditions”, etc. Simple causal structures are usually present.
Goodhart usually detectable by indicator words such as “rewards” or “incentivizes”.
Confounder mediator is often called out by the term “mediate”, making the mediating variable explicit.
Variables marked as “latent cause” are usually REVERSE trap type
Counterfactuals:
ASSUME term heavily implies counterfactual, and tends toward YES because of how it tries to justify the structural causal model.
Controlled simulation also tends to result in YES case.
