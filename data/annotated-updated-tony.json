      "ifScenarioA": "Answer if control neighborhoods were affected by other shocks: The observed property price increase may not be solely due to the luxury development.",
      "ifScenarioB": "Answer if control neighborhoods were unaffected by other shocks: The synthetic control method likely isolates the development's impact, supporting the claim."

    "wiseRefusal": "AMBIGUOUS - cannot definitively evaluate. The synthetic control method is used, but it is unclear if the control neighborhoods were appropriately selected or if there were other concurrent economic shocks. Determining causality requires verifying these assumptions.",
    "explanation": "The scenario employs a synthetic control method to isolate the impact of the luxury housing development on property prices. However, the claim's validity depends on the assumptions about the method's appropriateness, such as the selection of control neighborhoods and the absence of parallel economic shocks. Without this information, the claim remains ambiguous."
