    "wiseRefusal": "NO - the claim is invalid. The scenario demonstrates a selection bias by highlighting only those who survived using the strategy, ignoring the 80% who failed. This creates a distorted view of the strategy's effectiveness, suggesting it would have led to survival when, in fact, it often did not.",
    "explanation": "The scenario explicitly reveals a selection bias trap by showing only fund managers who survived the crisis claimed success with the high-risk strategy. The claim overlooks the fact that a majority who used the strategy failed, which distorts the causal inference about its effectiveness."
