The causal identification is sound because the Central Bank’s collateral suspension happened first and directly triggered forced selling via margin/collateral constraints, producing the incremental 8-point leg down. Evidence supporting the causal link is the timing (price dropped sharply immediately after the eligibility announcement) and the mechanism (ineligible collateral forces leveraged holders to unwind), plus the fact that the Treasury’s backstop was not activated because the bonds were no longer qualifying. Alternative explanations are ruled out for the incremental move because the bankruptcy news explains the initial widening, but the additional discrete selloff is tied to the policy-induced constraint and the preemption of the Treasury’s stabilizing purchases; without the suspension, Treasury buying would have absorbed supply and prevented that extra 8-point drop.",
    "gold_rationale": "This is overdetermination with preemption: both (i) bankruptcy-driven selling and (ii) policy-driven forced unwinds were each sufficient to drive a large move, but the Central Bank’s early collateral suspension triggered forced deleveraging and simultaneously blocked the Treasury’s planned stabilizing bid. The counterfactual is about the preempting cause (the Central Bank’s suspension), and it is supported because removing that action restores the backup path (Treasury buying) that would have prevented the incremental additional drop.",
